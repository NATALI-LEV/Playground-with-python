##Solar System simulation in Python(rotation)
This Python project offers a captivating planet simulation, providing a visual representation of celestial bodies' movements within our solar system. The simulation includes the Sun, Earth, Mars, Mercury, and Venus, each with accurate initial conditions such as mass, velocity, and orbit.

##Key Features
Astronomy and Math basics.
Realistic planetary motion using Newton's law of universal gravitation.
Visualization of orbits and distances from the Sun.
Adjustable time step for dynamic simulation control.
An intuitive and interactive graphical interface using Pygame.
