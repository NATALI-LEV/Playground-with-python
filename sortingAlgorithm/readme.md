# Sorting Algorithm Visualization using Pygame

This Python program utilizes Pygame to visualize two sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort. It generates a graphical representation of the sorting process for a list of elements.

## Usage
Run the program by executing python algorithms.py in your terminal or command prompt.

Once the program starts, you can perform the following actions:

- R - Reset the visualization with a new random list.
- SPACE - Start sorting the current list using the selected sorting algorithm.
- A - Sort in ascending order.
- D - Sort in descending order.
- I - Choose Insertion Sort algorithm.
- B - Choose Bubble Sort algorithm.
The visualization window displays the sorting process graphically. Bars represent elements, and their positions change as the sorting progresses.
